# Distributional Robustness

Code for experiments on natural transformations for paper titled: [Certifying Model Accuracy under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12440).
It is adapted from the publicly availabe [code repository](https://github.com/locuslab/smoothing) for the paper [Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918) by (Cohen et al. 2019).
