# Distributional Robustness

Code for experiments in paper titled: [Certifying Model Accuracy under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12440).
It is adapted from the publicly availabe [code repository](https://github.com/locuslab/smoothing) for the paper [Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918) by (Cohen et al. 2019).

This repository contains three sets of distribution shifts: Natural Shifts, Adversarial Shifts and Unlearnable Datasets. Details of each experiment is available in the README of the corresponding directory.
